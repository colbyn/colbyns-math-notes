== §3.3 | Double- and Half-Angle Identities

.Double-Angle Identities
****
- **Remember for Exams.** The professor said this isn't given during the Exam, and that we need to know this, said this in the context of Double-Angle & Half-Angle Identities.
- The **Double-Angle Identities** are easy to derive from the **Sum and Difference Identities**.

.Half-Angle Identities
****
**Remember for Exams.** The professor said this isn't given during the Exam, and that we need to know this, said this in the context of Double-Angle & Half-Angle Identities, she may have been talking about just the Double-Angle Identities.

[WARNING]
====
The choice of ranges for stem:[\arcsin(x)] and stem:[\arccos(x)] is not universally accepted.

.Identities for the Inverse Secant, Cosecant, and Cotangent Functions
****
// If stem:[-1 \leq x \leq 1] then:

// - stem:[\csc^{-1}x = \sin^{-1}\frac{1}{x}]
// - stem:[\sec^{-1}x = \cos^{-1}\frac{1}{x}]

// If stem:[x] is a real number, then:

// - stem:[\cot^{-1}x = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}x]
