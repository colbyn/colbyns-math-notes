== §3.3 | Double- and Half-Angle Identities

.Double-Angle Identities
****
- **Remember for Exams.** The professor said this isn't given during the Exam, and that we need to know this, said this in the context of Double-Angle & Half-Angle Identities.
- The **Double-Angle Identities** are easy to derive from the **Sum and Difference Identities**.

.Half-Angle Identities
****
**Remember for Exams.** The professor said this isn't given during the Exam, and that we need to know this, said this in the context of Double-Angle & Half-Angle Identities, she may have been talking about just the Double-Angle Identities.
